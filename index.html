        <h2>Die for you by Weeknd ft. Ariana Grande.</h2>
        <p>I'm findin' ways to articulate the feelin' I'm goin' through <br>
            I just can't say I don't love you (Yeah) <br>
            'Cause I love you, yeah <br>
            It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold <br>
            But tonight, I'm gon' let you know <br>
            Let me tell the truth <br>
            Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes<br>
            You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry<br>
            You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night<br>
            I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time<br>
            I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love<br>
            I try to find a reason to pull us apart<br>
            It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect<br>
            And I know that you're worth it<br>
            I can't walk away, oh<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Even though we're goin' through it <br>
            And it makes you feel alone<br>
            Just know that I would die for you<br>
            Baby, I would die for you, yeah<br>
            The distance and the time between us<br>
            It'll never change my mind 'cause<br>
            Baby, I would die for you<br>
            Baby, I would die for you, yeah (Say) <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm findin' ways to manipulate the feelin' you're goin' through <br>
            But, baby girl, I'm not blamin' you <br>
            Just don't blame me, too, yeah<br>
            'Cause I can't take this pain forever<br>
            And you won't find no one that's better<br>
            'Cause I'm right for you, babe<br>
            I think I'm right for you, babe<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes<br>
            You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry<br>
            It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect<br>
            And I know that you're worth it<br>
            I can't walk away, oh<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Even though we're goin' through it <br>
            And it makes you feel alone<br>
            Just know that I would die for you <br>
            Baby, I would die for you, yeah<br>
            The distance and the time between us<br>
            It'll never change my mind 'cause<br>
            Baby, I would die for you, uh<br>
            Baby, I would die for you, yeah<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            I would die for you, I would lie for you<br>
            Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby <br>
            I'm just sayin', yeah<br>
            I would die for you, I would lie for you<br>
            Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby<br>
            Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Even though we're goin' through it<br>
            And it makes you feel alone<br>
            Just know that I would die for you<br>
            Baby, I would die for you, yeah<br>
            The distance and the time between us<br>
            It'll never change my mind 'cause<br>
            Baby, I would die for you<br>
            Baby, I would die for you, yeah (Oh, babe)<br>
